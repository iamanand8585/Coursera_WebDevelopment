                <h3>Paul Bourget</h3>
                <p>“It’s never too late to think big. Widen your horizons. Look beyond your normal limits. See things in a larger picture. Consider the next step. The flow-on effect. Opportunities will become evident. Motivations will become clear. Perspective will emerge. One must live the way one thinks or end up thinking the way one has lived.” </p>

                <p> “To THINK BIG and to use our talents doesn’t mean we won’t have difficulties along the way. We will–we all do. If we choose to see the obstacles in our path as barriers, we stop trying. “We can’t win,” we moan. “They won’t let us win.”</p>

                <h3>Martin Luther King Jr</h3>
                <p>“If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a Michaelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, ‘Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.”</p>
